# Crypto Portfolios - Group by Transactions Software Project RoR (Ruby on Rails)


In this project, I've been working on making an app to register
financial investments with cryptos and no cryptos, you can generate
different portfolios to group your investments according to your requirements, also you can support someone's portfolio, but it only if you and your partners want to do that.

This project was created according to the requirements of the client to generate a rails app Minimum Viable Product MVP, feel free to give me your feedback and feel free to use it if you want to do it as well.

### Disclamer ‚ö†

In this app, you can't enter your real money, it's just a base to register your own portfolio, according to your financial investments in cryptos, or external financial resources.
